# js-ds-algo

Data structures and algorithms in JavaScript for a course taught by Stephen Grider.

I specify wherever implementations are my own or are the ones provided and elucidated by the instructor. 

In some cases, having both present provides a useful reference for comparison, as sometimes I opt for more of a Java-style implementation (much less compact, lack of method chaining, old-school for loops, etc.).

I've also included the test files provided by the Grider. The Jest testing framework is used for this course.

I'll continue adding to this as I work on more problems.
